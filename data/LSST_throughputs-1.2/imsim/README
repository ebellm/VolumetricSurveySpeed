This directory contains the throughput curves represented by the imsim images.

The 'goal' directory contains the curves that the imsim is currently attempting to
match. Because the imsim uses physics to reproduce some of these curves (such as the detector)
the output from imsim's raytrace code will not match these curves exactly, but should be
close. 

Because of the need to match code to actual throughput, rather than just being
able to substitute a different file, the imsim will potentially lag behind the 
current "baseline" or various development curves. (thus the reason for this collection). 

The 'actual' directory contains throughput curves produced by raytrace's efficiency.pro tool,
which represent the actual throughput resulting from the image simulator.

The actual raytrace code output will differ from the goal curves due to: 
- atmosphere (imsim raytrace uses its own simulated atmosphere, and does so in a
series of screens)
- filter throughput (raytrace uses the actual incident angle of the photons to predict
how they will travel through the filter, rather than just the response averaged over a 
variety of incident angles - which is what is represented in these single curves - they are
averaged to an incident angle of about 14 degrees)
- detector sensitivity (raytrace simulates the detector's response to photons, along with
various coatings on the detector surface).
